An Android application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Coroutines Flow, StateFlow, Retrofit, Dagger-Hilt, ViewModel, Compose Navigation, Coil and some other libraries.
The app fetches data from the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) to provide pokemon informations.

## Built With: 
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) First class and official programming language for Android development.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)   help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)  A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
* [StateFlow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) A Flow that represents a read-only state with a single updatable data value that emits updates to the value to its collectors
* [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for Dependency Injection
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)  A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) for HTTP and HTTP/2 client
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
* [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) provides an alternative syntax to the traditional Groovy DSL with an enhanced editing experience in supported IDEs, with superior content assist, refactoring, documentation, and more.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
* [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
